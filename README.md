# NFRec
A Non-Functional Requirements Recommendation System

Our  goal  is  to  automate  the  definition  of  NFRs  given historical  data  of  Scrum  projects,  supporting  the  team  on identifying them early in the process. For this purpose, in this paper, we present a NFRs recommendation system to support Scrum  practitioners. It  is  based  on  collaborative  filtering  and item recommendation and supported by an instrumentation of the Scrum process to enable the collection of quality data forthe recommendations.

 In this paper, we present the NFRec tool, which aims to support software developers in the elicitation of non-functional requirements in the context of agile software development. Additionally, we report the results from a case study to evaluate the acceptance of the NFRec tool from the point of view of software developers of four projects from a Brazilian software company. To gather information about the  tool  acceptance,  we  applied  a  questionnaire  based  on  the indicators  from  the  Technology  Acceptance  Model.  Overall,  the four teams considered the NFRec tool useful and easy to use forsupporting  the  management  of  non-functional  requirements  in agile  projects.
